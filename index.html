		<p>So this is your first time going to Japan and you have only a week. There are so many cities and regions to explore but start with these two must go cities first:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Tokyo</li>
			<li>Kyoto</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div>
		<p>I made a simple table of some of must to do in both cities.</p>
		<table border="1">
			<tr>
				<th>Activity</th>
				<th>Tokyo</th>
				<th>Kyoto</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Temples to see</td>
				<td>Senso-ji Temple</td>
				<td>Kinkaku-ji Temple</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Things to do</td>
				<td>Shopping in Harajuku</td>
				<td>Strolling around in Gion</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Food</td>
				<td colspan="2">Ramen and Sushi all day, everyday</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<p><a href="http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/japan-travel-tips/">Here</a> I found another amazing guide on Japan. What makes this page good is that it breaks down small topics and puts a navigation to each parts on top of the page. On the source code I saw different attributes for nav, nad header and other elements. A table or two would have been nice to have.</p>
